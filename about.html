  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <section id="vision">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our name, <strong>Praeceptor</strong>, is inspired by <em>Philip Melanchthon</em>—a quiet but formidable scholar of the Reformation, known as the <strong>Praeceptor Germaniae</strong> (“Teacher of Germany”). Melanchthon was the man behind the curtain, the one that was the scholar behind the scenes, the expert, the researcher, the analyst, if you will, who made Martin Luther who he was. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Melanchthon, we believe in supporting decision-makers from behind the scenes—with research, truth, and customized intelligence that allows others to shine in the spotlight. We aren’t here for the credit. We’re here for the outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We design hands-on, FERPA-compliant machine learning and analytics solutions that empower community colleges to act boldly on the truth hidden in their data. Real insight can’t come from one-size-fits-all dashboards; and privacy cannot be an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work is quiet. But the impact speaks volumes.
